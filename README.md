## Quick start (Codespaces / devcontainer) ✅
- Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces or with **Remote - Containers** in VS Code.
- The included devcontainer will install dependencies and forward port `4200`.
- Start the app inside the project folder with `npm start` (server listens on `0.0.0.0:4200`).

## Project folder
- App source: `│-1/` — open that folder in the container or run `cd "│-1" && npm start` locally.
